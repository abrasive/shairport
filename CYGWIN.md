Installing to Cygwin
----

This is based on installing onto a fresh default installation of Cygwin 2.4.1 (64-bit installation) running in Windows 10
inside VMWare Fusion on a Mac. 

Note: to enable Cygwin to resolve domain names, it was found necessary to go to Windows `Control Panel` > `Network and Internet` > `Network Connections` >
`Ethernet0` > `Properties` > `Internet Protocol Version 4 (TCP/IPv4)` > `Properties`, select `Use the following DNS server addresses`
and enter valid DNS server addresses, e.g. `8.8.8.8`.

* Use `Cygwin Setup` to install the following packages:
 * `pkg-config`
 * `autoconf`
 *  `automake`
 *  `clang`
 *  `libdaemon-devel`
 *  `popt-devel`
 *  `make`
 *  `libao-devel`
 *  `openssl-devel`
 *  `libtool`
 *  `git`
 * `wget` for convenience,
 * `flex` for compiling `libconfig`
 * `bison` for compiling `libconfig`

* Download, configure, compile and install `libconfig`.

For this, if your home directory name has a space in it, which happens by default with Cygwin, you should
temporarily rename it to a single word, e.g. `Mike Brady` -> `mike`. This is to allow the `make install` script to work properly.
```
$ wget http://www.hyperrealm.com/libconfig/libconfig-1.5.tar.gz
$ tar -xvzf  libconfig-1.5.tar.gz
$ cd libconfig-1.5
$ ./configure
$ make
$ make install
``` 
* Next, download, configure and compile Shairport Sync:
```
$ git clone https://github.com/mikebrady/shairport-sync.git
$ cd shairport-sync
$ autoreconf -fi
$ PKG_CONFIG_PATH=/usr/local/lib/pkgconfig ./configure --with-ao --with-ssl=openssl
$ make
```
* That's it. There should be a `shairport-sync.exe` file in your directory.
