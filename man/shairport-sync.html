  <h2>Description</h2>

    <p>shairport-sync  plays  audio  streamed  from  iTunes or from an AirPlay
    device to an audio device connected via an audio back end. At present,
    the only fully-implemented back end is for ALSA.</p>

    <p> A feature of shairport-sync is that the audio is played synchronously.
    This means that if many devices are playing the same stream at the same
    time, all the outputs will stay in step with one another.
    This allows multiple devices play the same source without getting out of phase with one another,
    enabling, for example, simultaneous multi-room operation.
    </p>

	


	<h2>Options</h2>


    <p>Many  of  the options take sensible default values, so you can normally
    ignore most of them. See the EXAMPLES section for typical usages.</p>

    <p>The command line for shairport-sync can take two kinds of options:
    regular <b>program options</b> and <b>audio backend options</b>.
    Program options are
    always listed first, followed by any audio backend options, preceded by
    a <b>--</b> symbol.</p>
    
  <h2>Program Options</h2>

  <p>These options are used by shairport-sync itself.</p>
  

  
	  
		<p><b>-a </b><em>service name</em><b> | --name=</b><em>service name</em></p>
		<p>
		Use this <em>service name</em> to identify this player in iTunes, etc.
    The default name is &quot;Shairport Sync on &lt;hostname&gt;&quot;.
    </p>
	  

	  
		<p><b>-A | --AirPlayLatency=</b><em>latency</em></p>
		<p>
		Use this <em>latency</em>, in frames, for audio streamed from an AirPlay
    device. The default is 88,200 frames, where there are 44,100
    frames to the second.
    </p>
	  

	  
		<p><b>-B </b><em>program</em><b> | --on-start=</b><em>program</em></p>
		<p>
		Execute <em>program</em> when playback is about to begin. Specify the 
		full path to the program, e.g. <em>/usr/bin/logger</em>.
		Executable scripts can be used, but they must have <em>#!/bin/sh</em> (or
		whatever is appropriate) in the headline.</p>
		
		<p>If you want shairport-sync to wait until the command has
		completed before starting to play, select the <b>-w</b> option as well.
		</p>
	  

	  
		<p><b>-D | --disconnectFromOutput</b></p>
		<p>
		Disconnect the shairport-sync daemon from the output device and
    exit. (Requires that the daemon has written its PID to an agreed
    file -- see the <b>-d</b> option).
		</p>
	  

	  
		<p><b>-d | --daemon</b></p>
		<p>
		Instruct shairport-sync to demonise itself. It will write its
    Process ID (PID) to a file, usually at
    <em>/var/run/shairport-sync.pid</em>, which is used by the
    <b>-k</b>, <b>-D</b> and <b>-R</b> options to locate
    the daemon at a later time.
		</p>
	  

	  
		<p><b>-E </b><em>program</em><b> | --on-stop=</b><em>program</em></p>
		<p>
		Execute <em>program</em> when playback has ended. Specify the 
		full path to the program, e.g. <em>/usr/bin/logger</em>.
		Executable scripts can be used, but they must have <em>#!/bin/sh</em> (or
		whatever is appropriate) in the headline.</p>		
		<p>If you want shairport-sync to wait until the command has
		completed before continuing, select the <b>-w</b> option as well.
		</p>
	  

	  
		<p><b>-h | --help</b></p>
		<p>
		Print brief help message and exit.
		</p>
	  

    
		<p><b>-i | --iTunesLatency=</b><em>latency</em></p>
		<p>
		Use this <em>latency</em>, in frames, for audio streamed from an iTunes
    source. The default is 99,400 frames, where there are 44,100
    frames to the second.
    </p>
	  

	  
		<p><b>-k | --kill</b></p>
		<p>
		Kill the shairport-sync daemon and exit. (Requires that the daemon has
		written its PID to an agreed file -- see the <b>-d</b> option).
		</p>
	  

	  
		<p><b>-m </b><em>mdnsbackend</em><b> | --mdns=</b><em>mdnsbackend</em></p>
		<p>
		Force the use of the specified mDNS backend to advertise the
    player on the network. The default is to try all mDNS backends until one
    works.
		</p>
	  

	  
		<p><b>-o </b><em>outputbackend</em><b> | --output=</b><em>outputbackend</em></p>
		<p>
		Force the use of the specified output backend to play the audio.
    The default is to try the first one. (This is not used at
    present.)
		</p>
	  

	  
		<p><b>-p </b><em>port</em><b> | --port=</b><em>port</em></p>
		<p>
		Listen for play requests on <em>port</em>. The default is to use port
    5000.
		</p>
	  

	  
		<p><b>-R | --reconnectToOutput</b></p>
		<p>
		Reconnect the shairport-sync daemon to the output device and
    exit. It may take a few seconds to synchronise. (Requires  that
    the daemon has written its PID to an agreed file -- see the <b>-d</b>
    option).
		</p>
	  

	  
		<p><b>-r </b><em>threshold</em><b> | --resync=</b><em>threshold</em></p>
		<p>
		Resynchronise if timings differ by more than <em>threshold</em> frames.
    If the output timing differs from the source timing by more than
    the threshold, output will be muted and a full resynchronisation
    will occur. The default threshold is 2,205 frames, i.e. 50
    milliseconds. Specify <b>0</b> to disable resynchronisation.
		</p>
	  

	  
		<p><b>--statistics=</b></p>
		<p>
		Print some statistics in the standard output, or in the logfile if in daemon mode.
		</p>
	  

	  
		<p><b>-S </b><em>mode</em><b> | --stuffing=</b><em>mode</em></p>
		<p>
		Stuff the audio stream using the <em>mode</em>.  &quot;Stuffing&quot; refers to the
    process of adding or removing frames of audio  to  or  from  the
    stream sent to the output device to keep it exactly in synchrony
    with the player.
    The default mode, <b>basic</b>, is normally almost  completely  inaudible.
    The  alternative mode, <b>soxr</b>, is even less obtrusive but
    requires much more processing power. For this mode, support for
    libsoxr, the SoX Resampler Library, must be selected when
    shairport-sync is compiled.
		</p>
	  

	  
		<p><b>-t </b><em>timeout</em><b> | --timeout=</b><em>timeout</em></p>
		<p>
		Exit play mode if the stream disappears for  more  than  <em>timeout</em>
    seconds.</p>
    <p>When shairport-sync plays an audio stream, it startes a play
    session and will return a busy signal to any other sources that
    attempt to use it. If the audio stream disappears for longer
    than <em>timeout</em> seconds, the play session will be terminated.
    If you  specify a timeout time of <b>0</b>,
    shairport-sync will never signal that
    it is busy and will not prevent other sources from &quot;barging in&quot;
    on an existing play session. The default value is 120 seconds.
		</p>
	  

	  
		<p><b>-V | --version</b></p>
		<p>
		Print version information and exit.
		</p>
	  

	  
		<p><b>-v | --verbose</b></p>
		<p>
		Print debug information. Repeat up to three times to get more detail.
		</p>
	  

	  
		<p><b>-w | --wait-cmd</b></p>
		<p>
		Wait for commands specified using <b>-B</b> or <b>-E</b>  to  complete  before
    continuing execution.
		</p>
	  

  <h2>Audio Backend Options</h2>

  <p>These  options are passed to the chosen audio backend. (At present, the
  only backend implemented is for ALSA.) The audio  backend  options  are
  preceded by a <b>--</b> symbol to introduce them and to separate them from any
  program options. In this way, option letters can be used  as  program
  options and also as audio backend options without ambiguity.</p>
  

  
  
  <p><b>-c </b><em>controlname</em></p>
  <p>
  Use the hardware volume control called <em>controlname</em>. This is needed if
  the output type is specified, using the <b>-t</b> option,
  to be <b>hardware</b>. There is no default.
  </p>
  

  
  <p><b>-d </b><em>device</em></p>
  <p>
  Use the specified output <em>device</em>.
  The default is the device named <b>default</b>.
  </p>
  

  
  <p><b>-t </b><em>devicetype</em></p>
  <p>
  The type of the output device is <em>devicetype</em> which must be
  <b>hardware</b> or <b>software</b>. The default is <b>software</b>.
  If you specify <b>hardware</b> you must also specify the name of the
  volume control using the <b>-c</b> option.
  </p>
  
	

  <h2>Examples</h2>

  <p>Here is a typical example:</p>
      shairport-sync  <b>-d</b>
      <b>-a &quot;Joe's Stereo&quot;</b>
      <b>-S soxr</b>
      <b>--</b>
      <b>-d hw:1</b>
      <b>-t hardware</b>
      <b>-c PCM</b>      
      <br>

  <p>The program will run in daemon mode ( <b>-d</b> ), will be  visible  as
  &quot;Joe's Stereo&quot; ( <b>-a &quot;Joe's Stereo&quot;</b> ) and will use the SoX Resampler Library-based stuffing ( <b>-S soxr</b> ).
  The audio backend options following  the  <b>--</b>  separator  specify
  that  the  audio will be output on the ALSA device called hw:1 (
  <b>-d hw:1</b> ), and will take advantage of that device's  hardware  (
  <b>-t hardware</b> ) mixer named &quot;PCM&quot; ( <b>-c &quot;PCM&quot;</b> ).
  </p>
