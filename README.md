ShairPort
=========
By [James Laird](mailto:jhl@mafipulation.org) ([announcement](http://mafipulation.org/blagoblig/2011/04/08#shairport))

What it is
----------
This program emulates an AirPort Express for the purpose of streaming music from iTunes and compatible iPods and iPhones. It implements a server for the Apple RAOP protocol.
ShairPort does not support AirPlay v2 (video and photo streaming).

Build Requirements
------------------
Required:
* OpenSSL

Optionally:
* libao
* PulseAudio
* avahi

Debian/Raspbian users can get the basics with
`apt-get install libssl-dev libavahi-client-dev libasound2-dev`


Runtime Requirements
--------------------
You must be running an mDNS (Bonjour) daemon. On a Mac, this will be running already. Otherwise, you must be running avahi-daemon or Howl.
As an alternative, you may use the tinysvcmdns backend, which embeds a lightweight mDNS daemon. It is, however, way less robust than bonjour or avahi.
Check the [mDNS Backends] section for more information.

How to get started
-------------
```
./configure
make
./shairport -a 'My Shairport Name'
```

The triangle-in-rectangle AirTunes (now AirPlay) logo will appear in the iTunes status bar of any machine on the network, or on iPod/iPhone play controls screen. Choose your access point name to start streaming to the ShairPort instance.

Audio Outputs
-------------
Shairport supports different audio backends.
For a list of available backends and their options, run `shairport -h`.
Note that options are supplied to backends at the end of the commandline, separated by --, for example:
```
shairport -o ao -- -d mydriver -o setting=thing
```

mDNS Backends
-------------
Shairport uses mDNS to advertise the service. Multiple backends are available to perform the task.
For a list of available backends, run `shairport -h`.
The backends prefixed by 'external' rely on external programs that should be present in your path.
By default, shairport will try all backends, in the order they are listed by `shairport -h`, until one works.
You can force the use of a specific backend using `shairport -m tinysvcmdns` for example.

Metadata
--------

The following metadata can be output for the currently playing track:

  * artist
  * title
  * album
  * artwork
  * genre
  * comment

To enable the output of metadata, the `-M <directory name>` flag must be set to
instruct `shairport` where to save the output. This directory must exist. A
fifo named `now_playing` will be created, and records will be written to it
when tracks are changed. The end of a set of metadata is delimited by a
zero-length line. Cover filenames are relative to the cover directory. Files
are not deleted.

An example::

    artist=Arcade Fire
    title=City With No Children
    album=The Suburbs
    artwork=cover-e6450a45ab900815e831434f5ee0499c.jpg
    genre=Rock
    comment=
    
DACP
----
Most devices allow the AirPlay receiver to have basic remote control over the stream. This is done via simple HTTP GET requests from the 
receiver to the source device. The device sends a `DACP-ID` header to allow the receiver to find hostname and port numbers from mDNS, as well as an
`Active-Remote` header that must be used as an authentication key for issuing control commands. Similar to the Metadata feature outlined above,
this information can be read from a fifo after a device announces an audio stream. Using the `-D <directory name>` flag will cause a fifo named
`dacp` to be created in the directory specified. This fifo will have a similar format as the metadata.

Fields:
```
dacp_id=CFAE09D9DA7527E9
active_remote=3951361179
```

To issue control commands, you must do an mDNS lookup for `iTunes_Ctrl_<dacp_id>._dacp._tcp.local`. iTunes will always advertise on port 3689 so depending
on the environment, it may be possible to skip the mDNS lookup if you already know the source IP or hostname. iOS devices seem to choose a random high-numbered 
port. Once you have found the host and port number, you may issue HTTP GET requests in the following format:

`http://<hostname>:<port>/ctrl-int/1/<cmd>`

Where `<cmd>` may be one of:
```
beginff
beginrew
mutetoggle
nextitem
previtem
pause
playpause
play
stop
playresume (after issuing beginff or beginrew)
shuffle_songs
volumedown
volumeup
```
Your HTTP request must include an `Active-Remote` header with the value obtained from the fifo.


Thanks
------
Big thanks to David Hammerton for releasing an ALAC decoder, which is reproduced here in full.
Thanks to everyone who has worked to reverse engineer the RAOP protocol - after finding the keys, everything else was pretty much trivial.
Thanks also to Apple for obfuscating the private key in the ROM image, using a scheme that made the deobfuscation code itself stand out like a flare.
Thanks to Ten Thousand Free Men and their Families for having a computer and stuff.
Thanks to wtbw.
