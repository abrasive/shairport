What it is
----------
This program emulates an Airport Express for the purpose of streaming music from iTunes and compatible iPods. It implements a server for the Apple RAOP protocol.

It probably supports multiple simultaneous streams, if your audio output chain (as detected by libao) does so.

How to use it
-------------
1. Make sure avahi-daemon is running and the prerequisites are installed (see INSTALL).
2. Edit shairport.pl with your favourite text editor to set the access point name and/or password, if desired.
3. `perl shairport.pl`

The triangle-in-rectangle Airtunes logo will appear in the iTunes status bar of any machine on the network, or on iPod play controls screen. Choose your access point name to start streaming to the Shairport instance.

Thanks
------
Big thanks to David Hammerton for releasing an ALAC decoder, which is reproduced here in full.
Thanks to everyone who has worked to reverse engineer the RAOP protocol - after finding the keys, everything else was pretty much trivial.
Thanks also to Apple for obfuscating the private key in the ROM image, using a scheme that made the deobfuscation code itself stand out like a flare.
Thanks to Ten Thousand Free Men and their Families for having a computer and stuff.
Thanks to wtbw.
